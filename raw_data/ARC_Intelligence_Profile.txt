ARC Intelligence: A 2,000‑Word Profile of the Berlin Startup Bringing “Financial Intelligence” to CFOs 1) Introduction ARC Intelligence GmbH is a Berlin‑based software company focused on one big idea: turn the messy, fragmented data inside small and mid‑sized companies into clear, decision‑ready insight for finance leaders. Instead of asking a CFO to assemble a patchwork of tools and consultants, ARC Intelligence offers a unified product that connects to the company’s existing systems, cleans and models the data in a consistent way, and then layers analytics, automation, and business intelligence on top. The outcome is meant to feel less like a traditional dashboard stack and more like an “always‑on” finance copilot—software that is available 24/7, answers questions in natural language, and produces reports and recommendations when they are needed, not weeks later. The company describes this promise succinctly on its website: “Financial Intelligence for CFOs who are shaping the future,” and “one software to get from raw data to insights.” It positions its software as a path to unlock the full potential of finance data without having to build a dedicated data team. For many European SMEs wrestling with complex ERP transitions, siloed spreadsheets, and recurring reporting cycles, that message resonates. 2) What the product is ARC Intelligence presents its product in three interconnected layers: Data Preparation (the “ARC Foundation”), Advanced Analytics and AI, and Business Intelligence (the “ARC Control Center”). Thinking in layers matters because most finance problems start as data problems. A budget variance or cash shortfall is rarely just a charting issue; it is a lineage issue across orders, invoices, and bank lines. ARC’s product is designed to address the full chain. • Data Preparation and the ARC Foundation. The base of the product is a secure, scalable semantic layer that acts as a single source of truth for financial data. ARC connects to common ERP, CRM, accounting, and MES systems, as well as to spreadsheets. It automates data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency, performs automated matching to link old and new identifiers, and preserves historical data so that a customer changing ERP systems does not “fall off a cliff” in their time series. This is exactly the pain that appears during system migrations or M&A integrations: codes change, data models change, but the business still needs quarter‑over‑quarter comparability. A future‑proof integration approach and automated mapping can remove weeks of manual reconciliation. • Advanced Analytics and AI. Once data is harmonized, ARC layers descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics on top. Descriptive analytics explain what happened and why. Predictive models project what could happen—demand, revenue, cash, inventory—by learning from historical patterns and operational drivers. Prescriptive logic simulates scenarios and proposes actions, such as optimizing reorder points, rebalancing a budget, or identifying cost levers that move the margin. ARC refers to an “AI agent framework”: rather than one giant model, it coordinates specialized components that can plan, execute, and iterate toward a goal using tools, documents, and domain knowledge. For finance teams, the benefit is the ability to ask more complex questions without writing SQL or maintaining brittle spreadsheets. • Business Intelligence and the Control Center. The top layer is the daily interface for users. It includes dashboards and visualizations, automated reporting (for example, generating a month‑end report pack on demand), anomaly detection, and “chat with your data.” Natural‑language querying lets a user type a question like “what drove the margin variance in Q2 Germany?” and receive a traceable answer tied back to the semantic model. GenAI meets GenBI: instead of endlessly building static dashboards, the system answers questions and pushes timely insights. 3) Who it is for ARC focuses on small and medium‑sized companies that have outgrown spreadsheet‑only finance but do not want to build a large internal data organization. Typical users include CFOs, heads of controlling, FP&A managers, and business analysts. The buyer profile often has multiple legal entities, a mix of modern and legacy systems, and recurring questions about working capital, inventory turns, unit economics, and cash runway. For these teams, a quick path to consistent KPIs and reliable drill‑through down to the transaction level is more valuable than a blank canvas of tools. 4) Claimed impact On its public site, ARC summarizes the results customers can expect in concrete terms: hundreds of thousands of euros in data operations costs saved, much faster access to data, thousands of hours of manual work eliminated, dozens of sources interconnected, and a measurable lift in operational efficiency. Every company will realize different numbers based on its starting point, but the direction is familiar to any finance leader. When highly skilled people spend days copy‑pasting CSVs, reconciling IDs, and re‑calculating the same KPIs in different silos, value leaks. When that work is systematized, the team can focus on decisions. 5) Security, privacy, and deployment Finance organizations are rightly cautious about where their data lives and who can touch it. ARC states that customer data is stored on AWS servers located in Germany and that the platform complies with GDPR (DSGVO) as well as CCPA. For many European SMEs, German data residency is a meaningful requirement. Implementation is not pitched as a never‑ending project: the company cites a typical setup and onboarding period of around four weeks from the moment data access is granted, subject to the number and complexity of systems. Pricing is subscription‑based—a monthly recurring fee that the company positions as “typically more affordable than hiring a single experienced data engineer.” The promise is value delivered as software, not time‑and‑materials consulting. 6) The company and team ARC Intelligence lists its leadership publicly: co‑founders Clemens Wessendorff (CEO) and Simon Zimmermann (CTO). The broader team spans software development, data engineering, and finance‑adjacent roles, and explicitly emphasizes experience with ERP ecosystems. ARC describes itself as a diverse group that includes backgrounds ranging from fine art and cancer research to “everything ERP,” united around the idea that finance software should remove complexity rather than add to it. The firm is headquartered in Berlin and operates as ARC Intelligence GmbH, reflecting its European focus and compliance posture. 7) Funding and traction In December 2024, ARC announced a pre‑seed round of roughly €1 million, led by 468 Capital with participation from IBB Ventures. Coverage in European startup publications framed the raise as fuel to develop the platform further and integrate additional features so SMEs can make data‑driven decisions with natural‑language tools. Notably, reporting highlighted early customers including DR. KADE, a German pharmaceutical company, and Network Factory, a Berlin‑based firm—examples that indicate traction with established mid‑market operators. Third‑party data platforms and investor pages list the company’s founding year as 2023 and its headquarters as Berlin, Germany. For prospective buyers, this combination—young but focused, funded by recognizable European investors, and already working with real SMEs—suggests a pragmatic go‑to‑market. 8) How ARC differs from a do‑it‑yourself stack Many finance teams experiment with assembling their own data stack: a cloud warehouse, an ELT tool, a transformation framework, and a visualization product. That approach can work, especially with strong internal engineering resources. The hidden costs emerge in the details: maintaining connectors, building and versioning a semantic layer, handling slowly changing dimensions, reconciling cross‑system IDs, writing driver trees for forecasting, and producing the “last mile” outputs that boards and auditors require. The promise of ARC is to ship those layers pre‑packaged for finance, complemented by an agentic layer that automates repetitive steps like generating narratives, variance explanations, or rolling forecast updates. The value proposition is not that a company could never do it themselves, but that a lean team can reach a trustworthy, auditable, and maintainable solution faster—and keep it current as systems evolve. 9) Use cases in detail • FP&A. ARC supports rolling forecasts, driver‑based planning, price‑volume‑mix analysis, and profitability views by product, channel, or customer. The semantic layer ensures that the “definition of done” is consistent across entities and time, so the FP&A team can spend less time debating definitions and more time testing scenarios. With predictive components, the system can project demand or revenue and propagate implications to cash and inventory. • Controlling and statutory/management reporting. Controllers need consistent KPI definitions, drill‑through to transactions, and reliable reconciliations for audits. ARC’s approach provides audit‑ready lineage from dashboards down to source records. Automated reporting can produce standardized packs each month, reducing the “closing scramble” and making variance explanations more repeatable. • Forecasting. Combining orders, pipeline, supplier terms, production capacity, and seasonality produces more realistic projections than a single‑source model. ARC’s AI agents can orchestrate those inputs, simulate scenarios, and suggest concrete actions—like adjusting reorder points or negotiating terms that improve working capital. • ERP transitions and M&A integration. During system changes, data continuity breaks. ARC’s automated matching and future‑proof integration are built to preserve history and link old to new schemas, so quarter‑over‑quarter, year‑over‑year comparisons remain intact. That continuity keeps the management narrative coherent through change. • Anomaly detection and continuous monitoring. Rather than waiting for month‑end, the platform watches metrics continuously—flagging revenue recognition anomalies, unusual expense spikes, or margin compression. Suggested next steps turn detection into action, shortening the loop from issue to intervention. 10) Customer experience and support model ARC describes itself as “more than a platform” when necessary. If an unusual question falls outside the standard product, a dedicated team of data engineers will step in and deliver an answer—typically within twenty‑four hours. For a CFO, this matters: finance calendars are inflexible, and a missed report can cascade into downstream delays. The hybrid model—platform first, services as a backstop—also accelerates product improvement, because the team sees edge cases and can fold common solutions back into the product. 11) Governance, auditability, and trust Modern finance teams need to explain numbers, not just show them. ARC’s semantic layer and catalog of validated KPIs provide clear definitions and traceability. Drill‑through connects summary views to journal entries or order lines. Versioning of metric definitions and report templates ensures that stakeholders know what changed and when. Hosting in Germany and alignment with GDPR/CCPA are part of a broader trust posture, which also includes standard enterprise security measures and role‑based access. 12) Implementation journey: what the first six weeks look like A typical rollout begins with discovery and source system access (ERP, CRM, MES, accounting, and spreadsheets). ARC then runs automated cleaning and mapping into the ARC Foundation, reconciling IDs and preserving history. Early benefits often come from unlocking cross‑system KPIs and retiring spreadsheet “shadow systems.” In parallel, finance teams enable the Control Center, stand up core dashboards, and test natural‑language queries for recurring questions. In weeks four to six, teams layer in predictive models for demand or cash, define thresholds for continuous monitoring, and turn on automated reporting to support the next close. 13) Pricing logic and ROI ARC uses a subscription model with a monthly recurring fee. The company positions the cost as lower than hiring a senior data engineer, which gives buyers a simple benchmark. CFOs can evaluate ROI by comparing the subscription to status‑quo costs: analyst hours spent on manual wrangling, delayed decisions from slow reporting, errors caught late, and consulting spend for ad hoc fixes. If the software can compress cycle times, improve accuracy, and reduce external spend, the payback is straightforward. Some organizations will quantify the benefit as time saved; others will focus on decisions made earlier with better data—like pulling forward a price change or avoiding an inventory shortfall. 14) Market context and timing Berlin is a useful home base for a company like ARC. Germany’s Mittelstand is full of sophisticated operators who nevertheless face talent constraints in data engineering and analytics. Many are mid‑modernization: consolidating after acquisitions, replacing aging systems, and looking for resilience amid supply chain and interest rate volatility. Regulatory expectations around data privacy elevate vendors that can prove compliance and data residency. In this context, ARC’s positioning—enterprise‑grade analytics and automation tuned for finance, delivered as product—fits the moment. 15) Roadmap signals While ARC does not publish a detailed public roadmap, its current emphasis points to several likely directions. Expect more connectors, deeper ERP semantics, and expansion of the agent framework to handle
